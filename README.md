This is a machine learning project created for FinTechs. It is designed to be used when they are planning on expanding internationally.

The project is a set of supervised learning algorithms to identify whether a country is awesome for international expansion or not.

The features:

- Starbucks Locations
- iPhone Users 
- ATMs per 1000 Adults

The output:

- 2017 Global Enterpnerhsip Index

## How is this useful

FinTechs like payments and lending solely see entrepreneurs as their target audience. Their market is people who accept payments in any form and want to manage these payments so what if there is a way to measure entrepreneurship in a country and the features that reflect that.

## Machine learining for real problems

I have yet to see a machine learning project used for day to day business problems. It's either let's figure out how to cure cancer or let's use a boring as hell government datasets to project future crime rates.

This project is different as it uses a couple of supervised learning algorithms and a set of sexy features that really can be used to reflect the level of entrepreneurship in a country
